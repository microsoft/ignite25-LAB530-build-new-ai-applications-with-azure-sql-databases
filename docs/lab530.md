</p>

Welcome, Investigator, to the **Cryptid Research Initiative**-a clandestine alliance of experts, explorers, and analysts dedicated to uncovering the world's most elusive beings. As a new member, you are now part of a centuries-old tradition of secret scientific inquiry, where we pursue the truth behind the legends that most dismiss as folklore. Our organization has established a global network of field operatives, local informants, and advanced data analysts, all tasked with researching, cataloging, and monitoring cryptid activity around the world. From the misty forests of the Pacific Northwest to the frozen peaks of the Himalayas, and the shadowed billabongs of the Australian outback, our research spans every continent and culture. You will be granted access to confidential video archives, eyewitness accounts, and analytical data-some gathered at great personal risk-so that you may contribute to the ever-growing body of knowledge. 

**Your pivotal role is to harness advanced artificial intelligence tools to analyze rare video evidence and, together with your colleagues, assemble the most comprehensive database of cryptid encounters ever known.** By applying cutting-edge techniques, your work will help reveal patterns, verify authenticity, and propel our understanding further than ever before. 

Welcome to the front lines of cryptozoological discovery-remember, secrecy and scientific rigor are the cornerstones of our society.

***The unknown awaits!***

# 3. Azure AI Content Understanding

Azure AI Content Understanding is a new Generative AI based Azure AI Service, designed to process/ingest content of any types (documents, images, videos, and audio) into a user-defined output format. We will be using it in this lab to analyze a video and have it return data fields we can insert into a database table.

## Call REST services from the Azure SQL Database with External REST Endpoint Invocation

But before we do, we need to understand how we are going to interact with the REST services that Azure AI Content Understanding provides.

### External REST Endpoint Invocation

Azure SQL Database External REST Endpoint Invocation provides the ability to call REST endpoints from other Azure services such as OpenAI, Azure Event Hub, Azure Functions, Power BI and more. Common use cases for developers to use External REST Endpoint Invocation are:

* Utilize Azure OpenAI services such as chat, embeddings, language, and content safety
* Ability to push business logic out of the database and into Azure Functions
* Pull/push data to/from external sources (including Azure Blob Storage) for ETL or derived data stores
* Participate in event-based architectures with Azure Event Hub or Kafka

External REST Endpoint Invocation can be called in an Azure SQL Database using the sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint stored procedure.

## Azure AI Content Understanding, REST, and the Azure SQL Database

In this section, you will use the External REST Endpoint Invocation (EREI) feature of the database to analyze a video using Azure AI Content Understanding. Step one is to create the analyzer with a user-defined output format. Next, we provide it with a video we have staged in Azure Storage. Once the video is analyzed, we can then take the user-defined output format and insert it into our database table. 

This section will also create a database scoped credential. A database scoped credential is a record in the database that contains authentication information for connecting to a resource outside the database. For this lab, we will be creating one for connecting to Azure OpenAI services and one for connecting to Azure AI Content Understanding.

## Creating the CryptozoologyVideos table

The first step in our quest for cryptid relevancy is to create a table to store our research. This table is going to need to track the results of our video analysis as well as previous videos that we received from fellow cryptozoologists around the world. 

1. Using the new query sheet in SSMS, **copy and paste** the following code to create our table:

	A few notes about our table. First, we limit a few of the values we can use in the **Time of Day** and **Threat Level** columns by using table constraints. These constraints will able be used with Azure AI Content Understanding. We are also using the IDENTITY property for VideoID that will create identity column in our table as well as act as our primary key.

    ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos]  
    (  
        VideoID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,  
        CryptidName      VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,  
        TimeOfDay        VARCHAR(100),       -- Will enforce certain allowed values  
        Location         VARCHAR(2000),  
        Weather          VARCHAR(2000),  
        VideoSetting     VARCHAR(2000),  
        VideoDescription VARCHAR(MAX),  
        CryptidLore      VARCHAR(MAX),
        ThreatLevel      VARCHAR(50),       -- Will enforce certain allowed values 
        Embeddings       VECTOR(1536),
        Chunk            NVARCHAR(MAX),
        CONSTRAINT CK_TimeOfDay CHECK  
        (  
            TimeOfDay IN  
            (  
                'Morning','Afternoon','Evening','Night',  
                'Dusk','Dawn','Midday','Late Night','Twilight',  
                'Late Afternoon','Early Morning','Midnight','Noon','Early Evening'  
            )  
        ),
        CONSTRAINT CK_ThreatLevel CHECK  
        (  
            ThreatLevel IN  
            (  
                'High','Medium','Low'  
            )  
        )  
    );  
    GO  
	```

1. Then **click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 12.46.46 PM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e.png){800}

1. Now that the table is created, copy and paste the following code into a blank query sheet. You can also remove the previous code by **highlighting it and pressing delete/backspace**.

	```SQL
    INSERT INTO [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos]  (CryptidName,  TimeOfDay,  Location,  Weather,  VideoSetting,  VideoDescription,  CryptidLore,  ThreatLevel)

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 12.53.29 PM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png)

	We now have 31 previous video reports in our database.

### Using T-SQL to create database scoped credentials

The next step in the lab is to create database scoped credentials which contain the API Key for using Azure AI Content Understanding by passing the credentials with our REST requests.

>[!KNOWLEDGE]
> Going forward, you can remove the previous code in a query sheet by **highlighting it and pressing delete/backspace** and reuse the query sheet for the next statement.

1. Using an empty query sheet in SSMS, copy and paste the following code:

    ```SQL

    -- Create a master key for the database
    if not exists(select * from sys.symmetric_keys where [name] = '##MS_DatabaseMasterKey##')
    begin
        create master key encryption by password = N'V3RYStr0NGP@ssw0rd!';
    end
    go

    -- Create the database scoped credential for Azure AI Content Understanding
    if not exists(select * from sys.database_scoped_credentials where [name] = '@lab.Variable(openaiApiEndpoint)contentunderstanding/')
    begin
        create database scoped credential [@lab.Variable(openaiApiEndpoint)contentunderstanding/]
        with identity = 'HTTPEndpointHeaders', secret = '{"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key":"@lab.Variable(openaiApiKey)","Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region":"westus"}';
    end
    go
	```

1. Then **click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 12.53.29 PM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png)

    The master key will be set, and the database scoped credential will be created.

### Using Azure AI Content Understanding's REST APIs

1. Back in the query sheet, remove the previous code by **highlighting it and pressing delete/backspace**.

1. The following code will call the Azure AI Content Understanding REST endpoint for creating an analyzer. We will be providing the analyzer with user-defined fields that we want the service to use. 

	As with our table, we can also define constraints on fields so that it only uses the supplied values as seen in this code example:

	For Time of Day:

	```JSON-nocode
    "TimeOfDay": {
        "type": "string",
        "method": "classify",
        "enum": [ "Morning","Afternoon","Evening","Night","Dusk","Dawn","Midday","Late Night","Twilight","Late Afternoon","Early Morning","Midnight","Noon","Early Evening" ]
    },
	```

	For Threat Level:

    ```JSON-nocode
    "ThreatLevel": {
        "type": "string",
        "method": "classify",
        "enum": [ "High", "Medium", "Low" ]
    }
    ```

	**Copy and paste** the following code into an **empty query sheet** in SSMS:

    ```SQL
    declare @url nvarchar(4000) = N'@lab.Variable(openaiApiEndpoint)contentunderstanding/analyzers/cryptidAnalyzer?api-version=2024-12-01-preview';
    declare @payload nvarchar(max) = N'{
        "description": "Cryptid video analyzer",

                "CryptidName": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Detailed summary of the video segment, focusing on identifying the cryptid."
                },
                "TimeOfDay": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "method": "classify",
                    "enum": [ "Morning","Afternoon","Evening","Night","Dusk","Dawn","Midday","Late Night","Twilight","Late Afternoon","Early Morning","Midnight","Noon","Early Evening" ]
                },
                "Location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Location of where the video was taken"
                },

                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Weather when the video was taken."
                },
                "VideoSetting": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The setting or background of the video."
                },
                "VideoDescription": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Detailed description of what is happening in the video."
                },

                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "Detailed background of the identified cryptid."
                },
                "ThreatLevel": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "method": "classify",
                    "enum": [ "High", "Medium", "Low" ]
                }
            }
        }
    }'
    declare @ret int, @response nvarchar(max);

    exec @ret = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint
        @url = @url,
        @method = 'PUT', 
        @payload = @payload,
        @credential = [@lab.Variable(openaiApiEndpoint)contentunderstanding/],    
        @timeout = 230,
        @response = @response output;

    select @ret as "Request return code", 
        json_value(@response, '$.response.status.http.code') as "HTTP return status code", 
        json_value(@response, '$.result.status') as "Analyzer status";
    ```

1. Then **click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 12.53.29 PM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png)

    With the result being:

    | Request return code | HTTP return status code | Analyzer status |
    |---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
    | 0                   |201                      |ready            |

    !IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 1.26.13 PM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 2.59.49 PM.png){700}

1. Now that the **video analyzer has been created** and is ready to be used, we can use another REST service to provide it with a video to analyze. This video is in Azure Storage so all we need to do is provide the analyzer with a URL.

	**Copy and paste** the following code into an **empty query sheet** in SSMS:

	```SQL
    declare @url nvarchar(4000) = N'@lab.Variable(openaiApiEndpoint)contentunderstanding/analyzers/cryptidAnalyzer:analyze?api-version=2024-12-01-preview';
    declare @payload nvarchar(max) = N'{
    "url": "@lab.Variable(sqlServerName)"}';
    declare @ret int, @response nvarchar(max);

    exec @ret = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint
        @url = @url,
        @method = 'POST', 
        @payload = @payload,
        @credential = [@lab.Variable(openaiApiEndpoint)contentunderstanding/], 
        @timeout = 230,
        @response = @response output;

    select @ret as "Request return code", 
            json_value(@response, '$.response.status.http.code') as "HTTP return status code",
            COALESCE(json_value(@response, '$.response.headers."operation-location"'),
                    json_value(@response, '$.response.headers."Operation-Location"')
            ) as "operation location URL",
            json_value(@response, '$.result.id') as "job id", json_value(@response, '$.result.status') as "job status";
    ```

1. Then **click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 12.53.29 PM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png)

	With the result being (**Your results will be different!**):

	| Request return code | HTTP return status code | operation location URL | job id | job status |
    |---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|--------|------------|
	| 0 | 202 | https://ignite25ai.cognitiveservices.azure
    /.../11111-22222-33333-44444-abcdefg... | 11111-22222-33333-44444-abcdefg | Running |

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 1.37.40 PM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.02.36 PM.png){850}

1. Looking at the results from this REST service in the table, the most important for the next section is the **job id** value. This value is needed to get the results of the analysis of our video. 

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 6.12.42 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.03.50 PM.png){500}

	Copy and paste that value from the results in SSMS by **clicking on the value in the table** then **right clicking the value** and selecting **copy**
    
    !IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 6.12.55 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.05.20 PM.png){500}

    then **paste** the value into the following text box and **press enter/return**.

    > [!ALERT]
    > **Paste the job id here and press return/enter -->** @lab.TextBox(jobId)

	**Once you paste the job ID in the field and press enter/return, continue with the next step.**

1. Did you remember to **paste** the **job id** into the above text field?

1. What did **Content Understanding** just do?

	Content Understanding processes video files through a customizable pipeline that can perform both content extraction and field extraction tasks. 
    
    !IMAGE[video-overview.png](instructions310533/video-overview.png){800}
    
    Content Extraction focuses on analyzing the video to generate foundational metadata, while Field Extraction uses that metadata to create more detailed, custom insights tailored to specific use cases.

	Field extraction enables the generation of structured data for each segment of the video, such as tags, categories, or descriptions, using a customizable schema tailored to your specific needs. This structured data makes it easier to organize, search, and automatically process video content efficiently. Field extraction uses a multimodal generative model to extract specific data from the video, using key frames and text output from Content Extraction as input. Field extraction enables the generative model to make detailed insights based on the visual content captured from shots, providing detailed identification.

    Remember, we provided the Field Extraction with the custom fields in a previous step when we created the Cryptid Video Analyzer. Now to get the results.

    > [!ALERT]
    > **Be sure to wait a minute or 2 for the video analyzer to finish it's job. We have many videos being analyzed from everyone in the class.**

1. As hinted at, our next REST call will **get the results of the video analysis and insert them into our cryptid videos table**.

	**My job id is @lab.Variable(jobId). <-- did you copy and paste the job id into the above text field?**

	**Copy and paste** the following code into an **empty query sheet** in SSMS (if you did not paste the job id into the above field, this request will fail):

	```SQL

    declare @ret int, @response nvarchar(max);

    exec @ret = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint
        @url = @url,
        @method = 'GET', 
        @credential = [@lab.Variable(openaiApiEndpoint)contentunderstanding/],    
        @timeout = 230,
        @response = @response output;

    --select @ret as ReturnCode, @response;

    declare @payload2 JSON = json_query(@response, '$.result.result.contents[0].fields');

    with analyzer_results as (
    select json_value(@payload2, '$.cryptidName.valueString') as CryptidName,
    json_value(@payload2, '$.timeOfDay.valueString') as TimeOfDay,
    json_value(@payload2, '$.location.valueString') as Location,

    select CryptidName, TimeOfDay, Location, Weather, VideoSetting, VideoDescription, CryptidLore, ThreatLevel from analyzer_results;

    select json_value(@response, '$.response.status.http.code') as "HTTP return status code",
    json_value(@response, '$.result.status') as "job status",
    json_value(@payload2, '$.cryptidName.valueString') as CryptidName,

    json_value(@payload2, '$.cryptidLore.valueString') as CryptidLore,
    json_value(@payload2, '$.threatLevel.valueString') as ThreatLevel
    ```

1. Then **click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 1.52.07 PM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png){750}

# 4. Creating embeddings for relational data

## Understanding embeddings in Azure OpenAI

An embedding is a special format of data representation that machine learning models and algorithms can easily use. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating-point numbers. Vector embeddings can help with semantic search by capturing the semantic similarity between terms. For example, "cat" and "kitty" have similar meanings, even though they are spelled differently. 

Embeddings created and stored in the Azure SQL Database during this lab will power a vector similarity search in a chat app you will build that is also powered by a gpt-4o model.

### Using T-SQL to create database scoped credentials (again) and testing a gpt-4o endpoint

1. This next section of code will first create database scoped credentials for using our gtp-4o and embeddings endpoints but also test the connectivity between Azure OpenAI and the database. 

	**Copy and paste** the following code into an **empty query sheet** in SSMS:


    ```SQL
    -- Create the database scoped credential for Azure OpenAI
    if not exists(select * from sys.database_scoped_credentials where [name] = 'https://ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id.openai.azure

    begin
        create database scoped credential [https://ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id.openai.azure.com/]
        with identity = 'HTTPEndpointHeaders', secret = '{"api-key":"@lab.Variable(openaiApiKey)"}';
    end
    go

	-- Test the connection by asking gpt-4o to tell us a joke (excellent use of AI)

    declare @url nvarchar(4000) = N'https://ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4o/chat/completions?api-version=2025-01-01-preview';
    declare @payload nvarchar(max) = N'{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are an expert joke teller."},

    exec @ret = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint
        @url = @url,
        @method = 'POST', 
        @payload = @payload,
        @credential = [https://ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id.openai.azure.com/],    
        @timeout = 230,
        @response = @response output;
        
    select @ret as ReturnCode, json_value(@response, '$.result.choices[0].message.content') as "Joke";
    ```

1. **Click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar. The result will be an amazing joke you can tell your friends and family!

    !IMAGE[A picture of running the T-SQL to create a llama bar joke](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.14.27 PM.png){1000}

	**Your joke will be different, but equally as awesome!**

    **Question:** tell me a joke about a llama walking into a bar.
    
    **Response:** A llama walks into a bar and the bartender says, "Hey, we have a drink named after you!" The llama looks surprised and asks, "You have a drink named Larry?"

    Classic Larry.

## The Azure OpenAI embeddings endpoint

Next, lets test our embeddings endpoint using the same database scoped credentials concatenated we just created.

1. This code calls an Azure OpenAI embeddings endpoint (using a text-embedding-ada-002 model). The result will be a JSON array of vectors.

	**Copy and paste** the following code into an **empty query sheet** in SSMS:

    ```SQL
    declare @url nvarchar(4000) = N'https://ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/text-embedding-ada-002/embeddings?api-version=2024-06-01';
    declare @message nvarchar(max) = 'Hello World!';
    declare @payload nvarchar(max) = N'{"input": "' + @message + '"}';

    declare @ret int, @response nvarchar(max);

    exec @ret = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint 
        @url = @url,
        @method = 'POST',
        @payload = @payload,
        @credential = [https://ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id.openai.azure.com/],
        @timeout = 230,
        @response = @response output;

    select @ret as ReturnCode, json_query(@response, '$.result.data[0].embedding') as "JSON Vector Array";
    ```

1. Again, **click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar. The result will be a JSON vector array.

    !IMAGE[A picture of the JSON vector array as a result of the query](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.15.50 PM.png){900}

    Using the built in JSON function json_query, we are able to extract JSON array from REST response payloads. 
    
	>[!WARNING]
    > **If you get a status 400 on this step, see the [Embedding Issue](#embeddingissue) section for a quick fix.**

    In the above T-SQL, **json_query(@response, '$.result.data[0].embedding') as "JSON Vector Array"** will extract the vector array from the result payload returned to us from the Azure OpenAI REST endpoint. 
    
    For reference, the JSON response message from the Azure OpenAI embeddings endpoint will look similar to the following and, you can see how we extract the array found at **$.result.data[0].embedding**.

        }
    }
    ```

    This JSON vector array can now be used with new vector datatype and functions in the Azure SQL database such as VECTOR_DISTANCE. 

## Creating an External Model Object

This next section of the lab will utilize some of the new AI features found in SQL Server 2025 and the Azure SQL Database. The first new features is the **EXTERNAL MODEL**. This creates an external model object that contains the location, authentication method, and purpose of an AI model inference endpoint.

The following code will create an **EXTERNAL MODEL** names embeddingModel which contains the Azure OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 endpoint as well as use the database scoped credentials that we created at the start of this section.

Copy and paste the following T-SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS to create the external model:

```SQL
CREATE EXTERNAL MODEL external_model_object_name
WITH
  (   LOCATION = 'https://ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/text-embedding-ada-002/embeddings?api-version=2024-06-01'
    , API_FORMAT = 'Azure OpenAI'
    , MODEL_TYPE = EMBEDDINGS
    , MODEL = 'text-embedding-ada-002'
    , CREDENTIAL = [https://ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id.openai.azure.com/]
  );
```

Next, you will use another new AI Features, the **ai_generate_embeddings** function. This function creates embeddings for text or a text column in a database table utilizing the external model that was just created.

Copy and paste the following T-SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS to use the ai_generate_embeddings function:

```SQL
select ai_generate_embeddings ('Hello World!' USE MODEL external_model_object_name);
```

## Creating embeddings on the cryptid data

1. Now that the **EXTERNAL MODEL** has been created and you are fimilar with **ai_generate_embeddings**, we can use these new features with the CryptozoologyVideos table. The embeddings vector array will consist of all the columns in the table that will be concatenated together and then passed to the ai_generate_embeddings. The resulting vector array will then be inserted into our vector column. The text sent to ai_generate_embeddings will also be stored in the chunk column.

	Copy and paste the following T-SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS to create embeddings for all products in the Products table:

    ```SQL
    SET NOCOUNT ON
    SET NOCOUNT ON
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #MYTEMP 
    DECLARE @VideoID int
    declare @text nvarchar(max);
    declare @vector vector(1536);
    SELECT * INTO #MYTEMP FROM [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos] 
    SELECT @VideoID = VideoID FROM #MYTEMP
    SELECT TOP(1) @VideoID = VideoID FROM #MYTEMP
    WHILE @@ROWCOUNT <> 0
    BEGIN
        set @text = (SELECT 'CryptidName: ' + CryptidName + ' '+ 
                            'TimeOfDay: ' + TimeOfDay + ' '+  
                            'Location: ' + Location + ' '+  
                            'Weather: ' + Weather + ' '+  
                            'VideoSetting: ' + VideoSetting + ' '+ 
                            'VideoDescription: ' + VideoDescription + ' '+ 
                            'CryptidLore: ' + CryptidLore + ' '+ 
                            'ThreatLevel: ' + ThreatLevel
                    FROM [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos] 
                    WHERE VideoID = @VideoID);
        update [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos] set [embeddings] = ai_generate_embeddings(@text USE MODEL external_model_object_name)
        , [chunk] = @text where VideoID = @VideoID;
        DELETE FROM #MYTEMP WHERE VideoID = @VideoID
        SELECT TOP(1) @VideoID = VideoID FROM #MYTEMP
    END
    ```

1. **Click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 2.59.26 PM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png){800}

1. To ensure all the embeddings were created, run the following code in a blank query editor in SSMS: 

    ```SQL
    select count(*) from [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos] where embeddings is null;
    ```

    You should get 0 for the result.

1. Run the next query in a blank query editor in SSMS to see the results of the above update to the Products table:

    ```SQL
    select top 10 chunk, embeddings from [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos];
    ```

    You can see the contents of the chunk column and the embeddings column that contains the vector arrays.

    !IMAGE[A picture of the query result showing the chunk and embeddings columns and their data.](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.17.58 PM.png){800}

## Vector similarity searching

Vector similarity searching is a technique used to find and retrieve data points that are similar to a given query, based on their vector representations. The similarity between two vectors is usually measured using a distance metric, such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. These metrics quantify the similarity between two vectors by calculating the angle between them or the distance between their coordinates in the vector space.

Vector similarity searching has numerous applications, such as recommendation systems, search engines, image and video retrieval, and natural language processing tasks. It allows for efficient and accurate retrieval of similar items, enabling users to find relevant information or discover related items quickly and effectively.

The VECTOR_DISTANCE function is a new feature of the Azure SQL Database that can calculate the distance between two vectors enabling similarity searching right in the database. 

The syntax is as follows:

```SQL-nocode
VECTOR_DISTANCE ( distance_metric, vector1, vector2 )
```

You will be using this function in some upcoming samples as well as in the RAG chat application; both utilizing the vectors you just created for the CryptozoologyVideos table.

1. The first query will pose the question "Which cryptids are prone to violence?". The similarity search will look at video descriptions, the threat level and the lore and find our answer.

    Run the following SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:

    ### Query 1

    ```SQL
    declare @search_text nvarchar(max) = 'Which cryptids are prone to violence?'
    declare @search_vector vector(1536) = ai_generate_embeddings(@search_text USE MODEL external_model_object_name);
    SELECT TOP(5) CryptidName, ThreatLevel, VideoDescription, vector_distance('cosine', @search_vector, embeddings) AS distance
    FROM [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos]
    ORDER BY distance
    ```

    And you can see from the results, the search found cryptids we should probably stay away from. 

    ### Query 1 results

    | CryptidName | ThreatLevel | VideoDescription | distance |
    |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
    | Beast of Bray Road | High | A hulking, wolf-like creature stands upright in the headlights, then lets out a guttural snarl and charges the vehicle, slamming against the door as the engine starts in panic. | 0.19328486881421836 |
    | Nandi Bear | High | A powerful, humped animal with fierce jaws charges the jeep, ramming the side as the videographer frantically pulls the door closed while it snarls outside. | 0.19721930143394784 |
    | Chupacabra | High | The camera shakes as a hunched, spined creature darts towards the videographer, letting out a guttural hiss and causing them to run for safety as livestock panic behind them. | 0.2021360096696173 |
    | Rougarou | High | A bipedal, wolf-headed monster explodes from the shadows, howling and racing toward the camera operator, whose panicked shouts and stumbling footsteps echo as the feed becomes erratic. | 0.2028660514587033 |
    | Kushtaka | High | A humanoid with sleek, otter-like features appears in the mist. As the camera focuses, the creature mimics a human scream, causing the videographer to stagger away in terror. | 0.20691461903098096 |

1. The next search will be looking to go on a trip to the Pacific Northwest...I wonder who we will meet there.... 

	Run the following SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:

    ### Query 2

    ```SQL
    declare @search_text nvarchar(max) = 'I am planning a trip to the pacific northwest, what cryptids will be there?'
    declare @search_vector vector(1536) = ai_generate_embeddings(@search_text USE MODEL external_model_object_name);
    SELECT TOP(5) CryptidName, ThreatLevel, Location, vector_distance('cosine', @search_vector, embeddings) AS distance
    FROM [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos]
    ORDER BY distance
    ```

    With the results returning 

    ### Query 2 results

    | CryptidName | ThreatLevel | Location | distance |
    |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
    | Bigfoot | Medium | Pacific Northwest, USA | 0.1629360620969421 |
    | Batsquatch |High | Mount St. Helens, Washington, USA | 0.18098621616578958 |
    | Ogopogo | Medium | Okanagan Lake, British Columbia, Canada | 0.20316492746641812 |
    | Kushtaka | High | Southeastern Alaska, USA | 0.2051566682581798 |
    | Fresno Nightcrawler | Low | Fresno, California, USA | 0.21079140658931717 |

	While we have results from other locations, you can see the distance for the top 2 matches being much lower but other matches are in the area such as British Columbia, Southeastern Alaska, and California.

1. In out last question, we can see how it interprets "aquatic reptiles".

    ### Query 3

    ```SQL
    declare @search_text nvarchar(max) = 'Which cryptids are aquatic reptiles?'
    declare @search_vector vector(1536) = ai_generate_embeddings(@search_text USE MODEL external_model_object_name);
    SELECT TOP(5) CryptidName, CryptidLore, vector_distance('cosine', @search_vector, embeddings) AS distance
    FROM [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos]
    ORDER BY distance
    ```

    With the results as follows:

    ### Query 3 results

# 5. Creating a chat application using RAG on relational data

In this section of the lab, you will be deploying a RAG application that uses embeddings, vector similarity search, relational data, and a large language model to craft an answer to someone searching our cryptid research database. In essence, putting all the pieces together in the previous sections to create a working chat application.

The framework for our application will be using Chainlit. Chainlit is an open-source Python package to build production ready Conversational AI applications that has integrations with popular libraries and frameworks. This application we are using is paired with LangChain. And what's LangChain? It's an open-source framework that allows developers to create applications using large language models (LLMs), and in our case, Azure OpenAI's deployed gpt-4o model.

The LLM will also help make sense of our data by looking at the results and crafting a more human response rather than a bunch of rows. It will also provide some insights into the data to create a more well rounded answer. This also allows us to ask more complex questions.

## Application Overview

The flow of our application is as follows:

!IMAGE[A picture of the application flow](instructions310533/arch.png){1200}

A user submits a question about a product via the Chainlit front end. That question is then sent to the database where it is embedded and a vector similarity search is done to match products to the question. The result of that search is then passed back to the Chainlit application where it constructs a prompt. This prompt is then passed over to Azure OpenAI (gpt-4) and received the answer. This answer is then presented back to the user via the Chainlit application.

In the section of the lab, you will create a stored procedure that will be used by the Chainlit application for taking in questions and returning products. Next, you will start up the application and interact with it to ask questions about Adventure Works products, just as we did previously with T-SQL calls.

## Creating the stored procedure used by the application

1. Copy and paste the following SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:

    ```SQL
    create or alter procedure [dbo].[get_cryptids]
    @text nvarchar(max),
    @top int = 30,
    @min_similarity decimal(19,16) = 0.60
    as
    if (@text is null) return;
    declare @qv vector(1536) = ai_generate_embeddings (@text USE MODEL external_model_object_name);
    with vector_results as (
    SELECT 
            CryptidName,
            TimeOfDay,
            Location,
            Weather,
            VideoSetting,
            VideoDescription,
            CryptidLore,
            ThreatLevel,
            vector_distance('cosine', @qv, embeddings) AS distance
    FROM
        [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos])
    select TOP(@top) CryptidName, TimeOfDay, Location, Weather, VideoSetting, VideoDescription, CryptidLore, ThreatLevel, distance
    from vector_results
    where (1-distance) > @min_similarity
    order by    
        distance asc;
    GO
    ```

1. Next, **click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar to create a stored procedure called **get_cryptids**. 

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.09.40 PM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png){700}

	It will be called by the Chainlit application in the **utilities.py** file as seen here:

    > [!TIP]
    > **This code is for reference only** 

    ```python-nocode
	def get_cryptids(search_text:str) -> str:
    	global user_token
    	if user_token == 1:
    	    user_token = get_conn()
    	conn_str=os.environ["SQL_PYTHON_DRIVER_CONNECTION_STRING"]
    	print(conn_str)
    	conn = pyodbc.connect(conn_str, attrs_before={1256:user_token})
    	logging.info("Querying MSSQL...")
    	logging.info(f"Message content: '{search_text}'")
    	try:        
        	cursor = conn.cursor()  
        	params = (search_text, )
        	cursor.execute("{CALL [dbo].[get_cryptids] (?)}", params)
        	output_value = cursor.fetchall()

        	logging.info(f"Found {len(output_value)} cryptids.")
        
        	payload = ""
        	for row in output_value:
            	payload += f'CryptidName: {row[0]}|TimeOfDay: {row[1]}|Location: {row[2]}|Weather: {row[3]}|VideoSetting: {row[4]}|"VideoDescription: "{row[5]}|"CryptidLore: "{row[6]}|"ThreatLevel: "{row[7]}'
            	payload += "\n"
        
        	return payload    
    	finally:
        	cursor.close()    
    ```

1. You can **test** this newly created procedure to see how it will interact with the Chainlit application by running the following SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:

    ```SQL
    exec [dbo].[get_cryptids] 'Are there any bears?'
    ```

    !IMAGE[A picture of using the TERMINAL tab on the bottom of the Visual Studio Code Editor](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.49.54 PM.png){1000}

1. Once in the terminal, start up the application with the following command in the Visual Studio Code terminal session:

    ```BASH
    chainlit run app.py
    ```

    And then **press enter/return**.

    > [!TIP]
    > You may see this pop up in Visual Studio Code in the lower right of the screen. Just **click the X** and close the pop-up.
    >!IMAGE[A picture of clicking the X on the keybindings pop-up in Visual Studio Code](instructions310533/Screenshot2024-11-04at8.38.10AM.png){700}

1. A **browser window** should open once the application has started. 

    !IMAGE[A picture of the browser window opening once the application has started](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.34.12 PM.png){800}

    Now that the application is running, use the chat text area to ask a question.

    !IMAGE[A picture of using the chat text area to ask a question](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.36.29 PM.png){1000}

    Start by asking it one of the questions we previously asked in T-SQL:

    ```TEXT
    I am planning a trip to the pacific northwest, what cryptids will be there?
    ```

    !IMAGE[A picture of asking the question "I am planning a trip to the pacific northwest, what cryptids will be there?"](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.40.24 PM.png){1000}

	and **press return/enter** or **click the green arrow**.

1. Once you start the chat, a new browser tab will appear in about 10 seconds. **Click on your lab username** in the Microsoft Azure, Pick an account section.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.53.40 PM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.53.40 PM.png){700}

	Once the page says "Authentication complete. You can close this window.", close the browser tab by clicking the X in the tab.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.53.59 PM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.53.59 PM.png){900}

1. Back in the chat app you should see your answer (You can scroll up to see the full answer if you missed it):

    !IMAGE[A picture of the returned answer from the chainlit application](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 3.24.39 PM.png){800}

1. Next, try the following question:

    ```TEXT
    Are there any links between non-humanoid cryptids and location?
    ```

    !IMAGE[A picture of asking the question "Are there any links between non-humanoid cryptids and location?"](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 6.33.14 AM.png){800}

1. Ask about weather and threat levels of cryptids:

    ```TEXT
	Are there any conclusions to be made based on threat level and weather conditions?
    ```

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 6.36.24 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 6.36.24 AM.png){800}


1. Looking for companionship?

    ```TEXT
	Can any cryptids be domesticated or exhibit friendly natures?
    ```

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 6.43.13 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 6.43.13 AM.png){800}

1. Battle for the ages!!!!!

    ```TEXT
	If all the cryptids in the database had a fight, who would win and why? Just give me the winner.
    ```

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 9.31.59 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 9.31.59 AM.png){800}

1. Now, ask about bears:

    ```TEXT
    Are there any bears?
    ```

    !IMAGE[A picture of asking the question "Are there any bears?"](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 6.44.25 AM.png){800}

1. Give it a try yourself and come up with a question!

## Stopping the Chainlit application

We need to **stop the application** so we can change some backend parameters and connection profiles.

1. Back in the terminal window in Visual Studio Code, **type Ctrl+C** to stop the application and you should be returned to a terminal prompt.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 3.28.22 PM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 4.00.44 PM.png){600}

# 6. Data security and RAG

In 2007, an amateur wildlife photographer in a remote British Columbia forest captured something extraordinary-a fleeting, grainy clip of a towering, ape-like figure charging directly at the camera before it vanished into the mist. By pure chance, a local news outlet obtained the footage and broadcast it. Within days, chaos erupted. Thrill-seekers and media swarmed the wilderness, police logged a spike in disappearances, and local rescue teams were overwhelmed searching for those who ignored warnings to "see Bigfoot for themselves." The area's fragile ecosystem was trampled, and several reported aggressive encounters with something unknown in the woods.

When the Cryptid Research Initiative intervened, they documented a troubling trend: every time incontrovertible video evidence of a high threat cryptid surfaced, public fascination tipped into reckless obsession. In several cases, well-meaning amateurs became victims-both physically and psychologically unprepared for what they encountered, while cryptid habitats were disturbed and their behaviors became more aggressive.

Today, the Initiative hides high threat entries for a single urgent reason: to prevent mass panic, protect both people and cryptids, and avert the catastrophic consequences that can arise when the unknown is unleashed without context or caution. Only seasoned analysts-like you-are entrusted with this knowledge, ensuring that research continues discreetly, ethically, and safely.

## Database Security

Next, let's work with some data level security features. Just because you are using RAG patterns with AI does not mean you no longer have control over your data; more so, what data is available to RAG, AI, and the application users.

For example, Adventure Works has a special product that they are offering only to employees. It can never show up as available for regular customers. So how can we restrict this data so that it cannot be bypassed by application code or AI searches? 

The answer is Row Level Security. Row-level security (RLS) enables you to use group membership or execution context to control access to rows in a database table. In this part of the lab, you will apply a policy on the products table that limits what data our aiuser can see when using our chat application. Seeing this policy is set on the user level and not at a level higher up in the application stack, it cannot be bypassed by removing application logic or direct connections to the database.

Row-level security (RLS) supports two types of security predicates:

* **Filter predicates** silently filter the rows available to read operations (SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE).
* **Block predicates** explicitly block write operations (AFTER INSERT, AFTER UPDATE, BEFORE UPDATE, BEFORE DELETE) that violate the predicate.

For this lab, we will be working with Filter Predicates.

## Create a web application user

In this section, we are going to create a limited privilege web application user that the Chainlit application will connect to the database with. It's never a good idea to have your sqladmin user or a user with the database owner role be the user we connect to the database with in an application.

1. 	Back in **SSMS**, **Copy and paste** the following T-SQL in a blank query editor:

    ```SQL
    CREATE USER [aiuser] WITH PASSWORD = 'kAgH7e!0D$#';

    ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER [aiuser];

    GRANT EXECUTE ON SCHEMA::dbo TO [aiuser];

	GRANT EXECUTE ON EXTERNAL MODEL::external_model_object_name TO [aiuser];

    GRANT EXECUTE ANY EXTERNAL ENDPOINT TO [aiuser];

    GRANT REFERENCES ON DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL :: [https://ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id.openai.azure.com/] TO [aiuser];
    ```

1. **Click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-07 at 6.09.37 AM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png)

## Update the application connect string and code

Back in **VS Code**, we have to **update the .env file** with the a **new connect string** to connect as the aiuser.

1. Open the **.env** file in the Visual Studio Code editor by clicking on the filename.

    !IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.20.05 PM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.20.05 PM.png){400}

1. Replace the values in the .env files by highlighting/selecting all the text and then copying and pasting the following parameters into the .env file. Then **save it**.

    ```ENV
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id.openai.azure.com/"
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="@lab.Variable(openaiApiKey)"
    AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT="gpt-4o"
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2024-06-01"
    SQL_PYTHON_DRIVER_CONNECTION_STRING="Driver={ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server};Server=tcp:azuresql@lab.LabInstance.Id.database.windows.net,1433;Database=SampleDB;Uid=aiuser;Pwd=kAgH7e!0D$#;Encrypt=yes;TrustServerCertificate=yes;Connection Timeout=30;"
    ```

1. **Save** the file with either **Ctrl-S** or use the **Save menu item**.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.27.55 PM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.27.55 PMs.png){500}

1. Now, click on the **utilities.py** file.

1. Select all the code in the file and replace it with the following:

	```python
    import json
    import os
    import struct
    import logging
    import pyodbc
    import re

    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    def get_cryptids(search_text:str) -> str:
        
        conn_str=os.environ["SQL_PYTHON_DRIVER_CONNECTION_STRING"]
        print(conn_str)
        conn = pyodbc.connect(conn_str,auto_commit=True)
        logging.info("Querying MSSQL...")
        logging.info(f"Message content: '{search_text}'")
        try:        
            cursor = conn.cursor()  
            params = (search_text, )
            cursor.execute("{CALL [dbo].[get_cryptids] (?)}", params)
            output_value = cursor.fetchall()

            logging.info(f"Found {len(output_value)} cryptids.")

            payload = ""
            for row in output_value:
                payload += f'CryptidName: {row[0]}|TimeOfDay: {row[1]}|Location: {row[2]}|Weather: {row[3]}|VideoSetting: {row[4]}|"VideoDescription: "{row[5]}|"CryptidLore: "{row[6]}|"ThreatLevel: "{row[7]}'
                payload += "\n"

            return payload    
        finally:
        	cursor.commit()
        	cursor.close()
            conn.close()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print(get_cryptids("bigfoot"))
	```

1. **Save** the file with either **Ctrl-S** or use the **Save menu item**.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.27.55 PM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.27.55 PMs.png){500}

## Create a filter predicate

Filter predicates are applied while reading data from the base table so here is where we will block access to high threat level cryptids. RLS filter predicates are functionally equivalent to appending a WHERE clause to a SQL statement. The predicate can be as sophisticated or can be as simple as WHERE ThreatLevel = 'High'.

This next section will be using SSMS so please change to use that application.

1. First, we need to create an **inline table-valued function** that will check to see **which user is accessing the table** and then blocking all high threat level cryptids. 

	**Copy and paste** the following T-SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:

    ```SQL
    CREATE or alter FUNCTION tvf_securitypredicate(@ThreatLevel AS nvarchar(10))
        RETURNS TABLE
    WITH SCHEMABINDING
    AS
        RETURN SELECT 1 AS tvf_securitypredicate_result
        WHERE (@ThreatLevel != 'High' and USER_NAME() = 'aiuser') or (USER_NAME() != 'aiuser');
    GO
    ```

1. **Click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-07 at 6.15.49 AM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png){800}

1. Next, we **create a security policy** adding the function you just created as a filter predicate. Note: The STATE must be set to ON to enable the policy.

	**Copy and paste** the following T-SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:

    ```SQL
    CREATE SECURITY POLICY ThreatLevelFilter
    ADD FILTER PREDICATE dbo.tvf_securitypredicate(ThreatLevel)
    ON [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos]
    WITH (STATE = ON);
    GO
    ```

1. **Click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-07 at 6.17.30 AM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png){800}

1. The last step is to **ensure that the user or group has been granted the SELECT permissions** to the tvf_securitypredicate function.

	**Copy and paste** the following T-SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:

    ```SQL
    GRANT SELECT ON dbo.tvf_securitypredicate TO aiuser;
    ```

1. **Click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-07 at 6.18.25 AM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png){800}

1. Now, we can **test the filtering predicate** by using the get_cryptids procedure and asking about bears because the Nandi Bear has a high threat level. This SQL will impersonate the aiuser because we are connected as a different user.
    
	**Copy and paste** the following T-SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:

    ```SQL
	EXECUTE AS USER = 'aiuser';
    exec [dbo].[get_cryptids] 'Are there any bears?'
    REVERT;
    ```

1. **Click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-07 at 6.20.34 AM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png){800}

    With the results **excluding** the Nandi Bear

    !IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 3.50.43 PM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 5.19.05 PM.png){800}

## Restarting the Chainlit Application

This section uses **VS Code**.

1. Start by going to a Visual Studio Code **terminal session**. You can do this 3 ways.

    **One**, Use the **menu bar on the top of Visual Studio Code**, select **View** and then click on **Terminal**.

    !IMAGE[A picture of using the menu bar on the top of Visual Studio Code, selecting View and then clicking on Terminal](instructions310533/Screenshot2024-10-28at9.10.52AM.png){300}

    **Two**, Use the **menu bar on the top of Visual Studio Code**, select **Terminal** and then click on **New Terminal**.

    !IMAGE[A picture of using the menu bar on the top of Visual Studio Code, selecting Terminal and then clicking on New Terminal](instructions310533/Screenshot2024-10-28at9.10.35AM.png){400}

    **Three**, Use the **TERMINAL** tab on the **bottom** of the Visual Studio Code Editor.

    !IMAGE[A picture of using the TERMINAL tab on the bottom of the Visual Studio Code Editor](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-10-15 at 3.49.54 PM.png){1000}

1. Once in the terminal, start up the application with the following command in the Visual Studio Code terminal session:

    ```BASH
    chainlit run app.py
    ```

    And then **press enter/return**.

    > [!TIP]
    > You may see this pop up in Visual Studio Code in the lower right of the screen. Just **click the X** and close the pop-up.
    >!IMAGE[A picture of clicking the X on the keybindings pop-up in Visual Studio Code](instructions310533/Screenshot2024-11-04at8.38.10AM.png){700}

1. A **browser window** should open once the application has started. 

    !IMAGE[A picture of the browser window opening once the application has started](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-02 at 2.34.12 PM.png){800}

    > [!KNOWLEDGE]
    > **Seeing the connect string contained a username and password, there will be no authentication model pop up window.** 

1. Now, go **back to the chat application in the browser** and ask it the following question:

    ```TEXT
    Are there any bears?
    ```

    Previously, the application did return the Nandi Bear. Now, we are told that it cannot find anything that matches that query.

    !IMAGE[A picture of asking the question "Are there any bears?" and not seeing any products because of the security policy.](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 3.56.38 PM.png){800}

    > [!ALERT]
    > **Using AI does not mean we have to compromise the security of our data; existing database security best practices still apply!** 

1. Want the public to know the **truth**? You can turn the filter off with the following SQL:

    ```SQL
    ALTER SECURITY POLICY ThreatLevelFilter
    WITH (STATE = OFF);
    ```

# 7. Ledger Tables and Prompt History

## Chat history storage

Prompt data is something that companies and organizations will want to preserve for training, evaluation, and analytics. How well did it perform? How are researchers using it? What questions are being asked. This data can also fall into the realm of high security. In this section of the lab, we will alter our stored procedure being used by Chainlit to store all prompts in a ledger table; more specifically an Append-only ledger table. Append-only ledger tables allow only INSERT operations on your tables, which ensure that privileged users such as database administrators can't alter data through traditional Data Manipulation Language operations.

This next section will use **SSMS** and the browser.

1. Create an Append-only ledger table.

	**Copy and paste** the following T-SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:
    
    ```SQL
    create table [dbo].[PromptHistory]
    (prompt_id bigint not null identity primary key,
    user_name nvarchar(100) not null,
    prompt nvarchar (max) not null)
    WITH (LEDGER = ON (APPEND_ONLY = ON));
    ```

1. Next, **click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar to create the **[dbo].[PromptHistory]** table. 

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 7.15.25 AM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png){800}

1. Next, we will alter our get_cryptids stored procedure to insert all prompts into this ledger table. Copy and paste the following SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:

    ```SQL
    create or alter procedure [dbo].[get_cryptids]
    @text nvarchar(max),
    @top int = 30,
    @min_similarity decimal(19,16) = 0.60
    as
    if (@text is null) return;
    declare @qv vector(1536) = ai_generate_embeddings (@text USE MODEL external_model_object_name);
    with vector_results as (
    SELECT 
            CryptidName,
            TimeOfDay,
            Location,
            Weather,
            VideoSetting,
            VideoDescription,
            CryptidLore,
            ThreatLevel,
            vector_distance('cosine', @qv, embeddings) AS distance
    FROM
        [dbo].[CryptozoologyVideos])
    select TOP(@top) CryptidName, TimeOfDay, Location, Weather, VideoSetting, VideoDescription, CryptidLore, ThreatLevel, distance
    from vector_results
    where (1-distance) > @min_similarity
    order by distance asc;

    -- insert into ledger table
    insert into [dbo].[PromptHistory] (user_name, prompt) values(USER_NAME(), @text);
    
    GO
    ```

1. **Click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar to recreate the **[dbo].[get_cryptids]** stored procedure. 

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 7.19.03 AM.png](instructions310533/ssms_e_s.png){800}

1. Now, **test the Chainlit application** and **query the ledger table**. 

    In the application, ask the following question:

    ```TEXT
    Do cryptids eat humans?
    ```

    !IMAGE[A picture of asking the chainlit application a question to be inserted into the ledger table](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-05 at 7.21.21 AM.png){800}

1. Copy and paste the following SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:

    ```SQL
    select * from [dbo].[PromptHistory];
    ```

1. **Click the Execute Query button** on the toolbar to run the SQL statement.

    !IMAGE[A picture of querying the ledger table and seeing the question just asked in the prompt field.](iinstructions310533/ssms_e_s.png){800}

	with the results being:

	| prompt_id | user_name | prompt |
    |-----------|-----------|--------|
    | 1 | aiuser | Do cryptids eat humans? |

1. Can we **update an Append-only ledger table**? Copy and paste the following SQL in a blank query editor in SSMS:

    ```SQL
    update [dbo].[PromptHistory]
    set prompt = 'Do cryptids eat apples?' 
    where prompt_id = 1;
    ```

# Thank you!

As you close your laptops and gather your notes, remember that what you have seen and learned today is reserved for the select few willing to look beyond the shadows. The cryptids cataloged in our database are not just legends-they are mysteries, guardians, and sometimes threats, shaping the fringes of our world in ways most will never comprehend. 

Your work today has strengthened the boundaries between the known and the unknown, and has brought us one step closer to understanding-and responsibly managing-the extraordinary. As members of the Cryptid Research Initiative, discretion and curiosity are your greatest tools. Trust in your training, rely on your fellow investigators, and always question the evidence.

Now, as you leave this secure lab, hear the ritual code that binds our order together: "In research, we reveal. In secrecy, we protect." The world continues to sleep peacefully, unaware-because you stand vigilant.

**Stay alert. Stay curious. The unknown is out there, waiting for your next discovery.**

# 8. Troubleshooting and common issues {#troubleshooting}

## No Models? No Problem. {#no-models-no-problem}

If in part 1 of this lab you look at your deployed models in the Azure AI Factory and see none, follow these steps to deploy both the gpt-4o and text-embedding-ada-002 models.

1. If in part 1, you get to the **Manage deployments of your models and services** page and it is empty:

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 9.59.50 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 9.59.50 AM.png){800}

    Use the browser tabs and go **back to the AI Foundry Project details page** by clicking that tab.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.01.10 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.01.10 AM.png)

1. On the **AI Foundry Project details page**, look in the upper right corner of the page and find the **Azure Portal Tool Bar**.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.03.18 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.03.18 AM.png){800}

1. Find the **Cloud Shell icon** and click on it.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.06.01 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.06.01 AM.png){600}

1. A **Cloud Shell** window should open on the bottom of the browser.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.17.26 AM copy.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.17.26 AM copy.png){800}

    then, click the **PowerShell** button.

    !IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.17.26 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.17.26 AM.png){800}

1. In the **Getting started** model window, 

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.20.57 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.20.57 AM.png){700}

	use the **Subscription dropdown** to select **Build-lodXYZ** (Where XYZ is a number unique to your environment/subscription).

    !IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.21.16 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.21.16 AM.png){400}

1. With the **Subscription** select list set, click the **blue Apply button**.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.24.48 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.24.48 AM.png){800}

1. The Cloud Shell will connect and you will be presented with a **PowerShell command prompt**.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.27.09 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.27.09 AM.png){700}

1. The first step is to **create a PowerShell script** that we can use to create the 2 model deployments.

	>[!Knowledge]
    > The copy and paste icons that you use in this lab unfortunately do not work with the Cloud Shell.
    >
    > You will manually have to copy and paste text into the Cloud Shell. Crtl+V also does not work.

	Copy the following text:

    ```PowerShell
    vi models.ps1
    ```
    
	PICTURE

    and paste it into the PowerShell window by **right clicking at the PowerShell prompt**.
    
    !IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.33.40 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.33.40 AM.png){600}

    at the command prompt.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.34.17 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.34.17 AM.png){500}

    then, press enter/return.

1. After **pressing enter/return**, you will be in the vi editor. Copy the following text:

	```PowerShell
    $modelG = New-Object -TypeName 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.CognitiveServices.Models.DeploymentModel' -Property @{
        Name = 'gpt-4o'
        Version = '2024-11-20'
        Format = 'OpenAI'
    }

    $propertiesG = New-Object -TypeName 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.CognitiveServices.Models.DeploymentProperties' -Property @{
        Model = $modelG
    }

    $skuG = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Azure.Management.CognitiveServices.Models.Sku" -Property @{
        Name = 'Standard'
        Capacity = '1000'
    }

    $modelA = New-Object -TypeName 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.CognitiveServices.Models.DeploymentModel' -Property @{
        Name = 'text-embedding-ada-002'
        Version = '2'
        Format = 'OpenAI'
    }

    $propertiesA = New-Object -TypeName 'Microsoft.Azure.Management.CognitiveServices.Models.DeploymentProperties' -Property @{
        Model = $modelA
    }

    $skuA = New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.Azure.Management.CognitiveServices.Models.Sku" -Property @{
        Name = 'Standard'
        Capacity = '350'
    }

    New-AzCognitiveServicesAccountDeployment -ResourceGroupName ignite25ResourceGroup -AccountName ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id -Name gpt-4o -Properties $propertiesG -Sku $skuG

    New-AzCognitiveServicesAccountDeployment -ResourceGroupName ignite25ResourceGroup -AccountName ignite25ai@lab.LabInstance.Id -Name text-embedding-ada-002 -Properties $propertiesA -Sku $skuA
    ```

	IMAETG HERE

	and paste it into the PowerShell window by **right clicking in the editor window**.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.39.46 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.39.46 AM.png){900}

1. To save the file, start by typing **Shift + :** (shift key and the colon/semicolon key). That will being you to the **vi editor prompt indicated by a colon**.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.44.47 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.44.47 AM.png){800}

1. At the **vi editor prompt**, type **w then q** (w key and the q key).

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.46.30 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.46.30 AM.png){400}

    and then **press enter/return** to save the file and quit out of the vi editor.

1. Now, at the PowerShell prompt, type or copy and paste the following text:

	```
    ./models.ps1
    ```
	
	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.49.53 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.49.53 AM.png){500}

    and then **press enter/return** to run the PowerShell script to deploy the models.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.52.12 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.52.12 AM.png){800}

1. Use the browser tabs to gp back to the **Manage deployments of your models and services** page.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.54.57 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.54.57 AM.png)

1. Back on the **Manage deployments of your models and services** page, click the **Refresh** button in the **Model deployments** section.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.57.18 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.57.18 AM.png){800}

1. You should now see the 2 deployed models.

	!IMAGE[Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.55.24 AM.png](instructions310533/Screenshot 2025-05-13 at 10.55.24 AM.png){800}

## Embedding Issue {#embeddingissue}

If you run into issues **(HTTP Status 400)** when creating embeddings, follow the following steps.

1. **Copy and paste** the following code into an empty query sheet in SSMS:

	```SQL
    -- Create the database scoped credential for Azure OpenAI
    if not exists(select * from sys.database_scoped_credentials where [name] = 'https://ignite25ai51537906.openai.azure
    /')
    begin
        create database scoped credential [https://ignite25ai51537906.openai.azure.com/]
        with identity = 'HTTPEndpointHeaders', secret = '{"api-key":"462f1365cfe947fba197ffe48557167f"}';
    end
    go

    -- Test the connection

    declare @url nvarchar(4000) = N'https://ignite25ai51537906.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/text-embedding-ada-002/embeddings?api-version=2024-06-01';
    declare @message nvarchar(max) = 'Hello World!';
    declare @payload nvarchar(max) = N'{"input": "' + @message + '"}';

    declare @ret int, @response nvarchar(max);

    exec @ret = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint 
        @url = @url,
        @method = 'POST',
        @payload = @payload,
        @credential = [https://ignite25ai51537906.openai.azure.com/],
        @timeout = 230,
        @response = @response output;

    select @ret as ReturnCode, json_query(@response, '$.result.data[0].embedding') as "JSON Vector Array";
    ```

1. Again, **click the run/Execute Query** button on the query sheet. The result will be a JSON vector array.

1. Later in the lab, you will create a procedure called get_embeddings. Use this following code with the updated endpoint.

1. **Copy and paste** the following code into an empty query sheet in SSMS:

	```SQL
    create or alter procedure dbo.create_embeddings
    (
        @input_text nvarchar(max),
        @embedding vector(1536) output
    )
    AS
    BEGIN
    declare @url varchar(max) = 'https://ignite25ai51537906.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/text-embedding-ada-002/embeddings?api-version=2024-06-01';
    declare @payload nvarchar(max) = json_object('input': @input_text);
    declare @response nvarchar(max);
    declare @retval int;

    -- Call to Azure OpenAI to get the embedding of the search text
    begin try
        exec @retval = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint
            @url = @url,
            @method = 'POST',
            @credential = [https://ignite25ai51537906.openai.azure.com/],
            @payload = @payload,
            @response = @response output;
    end try
    begin catch
        select 
            'SQL' as error_source, 
            error_number() as error_code,
            error_message() as error_message
        return;
    end catch
    if (@retval != 0) begin
        select 
            'OPENAI' as error_source, 
            json_value(@response, '$.result.error.code') as error_code,
            json_value(@response, '$.result.error.message') as error_message,
            @response as error_response
        return;
    end
    -- Parse the embedding returned by Azure OpenAI
    declare @json_embedding nvarchar(max) = json_query(@response, '$.result.data[0].embedding');

    -- Convert the JSON array to a vector and set return parameter
    set @embedding = CAST(@json_embedding AS VECTOR(1536));
    END;
	```

1. **Click the run/Execute Query** button on the query sheet.
